       Don't get faked—the AJ3 'Fire Red' is here <br>
       for real. Straight out the vault, the coveted <br>
       colourway returns true to form. It has the <br>
       same materials and flashy Blue <br>
       accents that hooked sneakerheads back <br> 
       in '06,plus original trimmings like a <br>
       bold Jumpman on the tongue and the famous <br>
       "wings" that let you customise your lace setup. <br>
       This ain't no knock-off. Get 'em while you can.
